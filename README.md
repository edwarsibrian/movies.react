# Movies.React 🎬

This project is a simple example of a movie registration system built with **React**.  
It allows you to:

- Register movies by **genre**.  
- Manage **actors** associated with movies.  
- Assign movies to different **cinema halls**.  
- Visualize information interactively.  

The app consumes a REST **API** (see [Movies.API](https://github.com/edwarsibrian/Movies.API) for the backend implementation).
